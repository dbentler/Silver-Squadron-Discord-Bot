# Welcome to the Silver Squadron Bot Development Wiki

Here you can find quick references to how stuff works and all of that jazz. It's great, isn't it?

Say you were gone a couple weeks, maybe on vacation or whatever. The others have added a bunch of new features and code. When you come back home, you have no idea what anything does.

Have no fear! That's what this wiki is for! Not only that, but it can give you some quick references to documentation on `discord.py` and all of that.

Or perhaps, you have no coding knowledge whatsoever but you want to contribute. You can use this wiki to learn what things are happening behind the scenes, learn some Python, and help contribute.
